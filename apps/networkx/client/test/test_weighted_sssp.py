def _weight_function(G, weight):
    """Returns a function that returns the weight of an edge.

    The returned function is specifically suitable for input to
    functions :func:`_dijkstra` and :func:`_bellman_ford_relaxation`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph.

    weight : string or function
        If it is callable, `weight` itself is returned. If it is a string,
        it is assumed to be the name of the edge attribute that represents
        the weight of an edge. In that case, a function is returned that
        gets the edge weight according to the specified edge attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    function
        This function returns a callable that accepts exactly three inputs:
        a node, an node adjacent to the first one, and the edge attribute
        dictionary for the eedge joining those nodes. That function returns
        a number representing the weight of an edge.

    If `G` is a multigraph, and `weight` is not callable, the
    minimum edge weight over all parallel edges is returned. If any edge
    does not have an attribute with key `weight`, it is assumed to
    have weight one.

def _dijkstra_multisource(
    G, sources, weight, pred=None, paths=None, cutoff=None, target=None
):
    """Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest weighted paths

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    sources : non-empty iterable of nodes
        Starting nodes for paths. If this is just an iterable containing
        a single node, then all paths computed by this function will
        start from that node. If there are two or more nodes in this
        iterable, the computed paths may begin from any one of the start
        nodes.

    weight: function
        Function with (u, v, data) input that returns that edge's weight
        or None to indicate a hidden edge

    pred: dict of lists, optional(default=None)
        dict to store a list of predecessors keyed by that node
        If None, predecessors are not stored.

    paths: dict, optional (default=None)
        dict to store the path list from source to each node, keyed by node.
        If None, paths are not stored.

    target : node label, optional
        Ending node for path. Search is halted when target is found.

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
        If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : dictionary
        A mapping from node to shortest distance to that node from one
        of the source nodes.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If any of `sources` is not in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    The optional predecessor and path dictionaries can be accessed by
    the caller through the original pred and paths objects passed
    as arguments. No need to explicitly return pred or paths.
